Genre classification of given audio using Tensorflow 
Embarking on this intriguing project, our exploration unfolds within the realm of the GTZAN Genre Classification dataset, an auditory tapestry comprising 1,000 tracks, each serenading the airwaves for precisely 30 seconds. Imbued with sonic diversity, this collection encapsulates the essence of 10 distinct genres, artfully manifested through 100 tracks each.Our musical odyssey navigates through genres as diverse as the rhythmic blues, the timeless classical, the heartland melodies of country, the infectious beats of disco, the lyrical prowess of hip-hop, the improvisational wonders of jazz, the raw energy of metal, the catchy tunes of pop, the rhythmic vibes of reggae, and the electrifying spirit of rock.Within this sonorous labyrinth, the dataset unfolds its treasures across three enthralling dimensions:Genres Original: A sonic tapestry featuring 10 genres, with each genre boasting a symphony of 100 audio files. These harmonies, all precisely 30 seconds in duration, have earned the GTZAN dataset its rightful place as the MNIST equivalent in the realm of sounds.Images Original: Capturing the essence of each auditory masterpiece, this collection offers a visual representation for every audio file. This visual cue opens the door to the realm of neural networks, inviting the fusion of auditory and visual dimensions in our quest for classification excellence.CSV Files: At the heart of our exploration lie two CSV files, each a trove of invaluable insights. One file meticulously documents the mean and variance of multiple features extracted from 30-second audio files. The other file mirrors this structure, but with a unique twist – songs are elegantly divided into bite-sized 3-second audio fragments, providing a granular view into the intricacies of each composition.As we delve into the symphony of data, these diverse dimensions promise a rich tapestry of exploration and discovery, inviting us to decipher the language of music through the lens of machine learning and deep analysis.
